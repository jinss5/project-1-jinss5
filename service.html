        Volunteering at local hackathons and coding workshops will help other
        students to learn how to code. Mentoring peer students at my university
        allows me to guide them through complex programming challenges and
        career development. In addition, contributing to open-source projects
        can also help the tech community by improving tools used widely. Looking
        to the future I am planning on creating and sharing educational content
        online, like tutorials and blogs, to share my knowledge.
