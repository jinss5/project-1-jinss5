      Hello, I am a student at Texas A&M University studying computer
      science.<br /><br />
      My interest is in software development and specifically, back-end web
      development.<br /><br />
      I have experience working at a start-up company as a back-end engineering
      intern<br />
      and am always looking to gain more experience.<br /><br />
      Thank you for visiting my website :)
