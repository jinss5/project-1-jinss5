      <h3>Areas of Interest in Computer Scienc</h3>
      <p>I am highly interested in back-end web development, which is about building the backbone of applications with a focus on functionality, security, and efficiency. I especially like how 
        it offers the opportunity to create the fundamental architecture that supports the core of the website. This involves not just programming, but also critical and logical thinking.</br> </p>
